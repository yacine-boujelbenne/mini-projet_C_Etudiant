This project is a prototype implemented in the C programming language, showcasing the use of structures to efficiently manage and organize data. 
The primary goal of the prototype is to demonstrate how structures can be used to model real-world entities, store related information, 
 and perform basic operations on them. The design focuses on simplicity and modularity, making it easy to understand and extend. 
This serves as a foundation for more complex systems where structured data management is critical.
